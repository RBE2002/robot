#About
This is the code for our WPI RBE2002 D-term 2015 final project.

The github repository for this code can be found at https://github.com/RBE2002/robot

All the code that actually ran on the final robot can be found in `final/`.

The remaining directories are for testing/calibrating individual mechanisms and
contain symbolic links to files in `final/`.

#Installation
This code should work be default with the standard Arduino IDE and
the WPI RBE Arduino Libraries. The libraries can be downloaded from:
http://wiki.wpi.edu/robotics/WPI_Arduino_Libraries

#Coordinate System
The coordinate system used for these file is relative to the starting position
of the robot, with the positive y axis pointing in the direction the robot
starts out pointing in, the positive x pointing to the right of the robot, and
positive angle being counter-clockwise.
